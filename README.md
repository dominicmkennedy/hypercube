# Hypercube

This is a fork of [Mashpoe's](https://github.com/Mashpoe/) hypercube, that I have ported to posix systems by using the ncurses library instead of the windows console library. The hypercube program is based on the paper [Four-Space Visualization of 4D Objects](https://hollasch.github.io/ray4/Four-Space_Visualization_of_4D_Objects.html#chapter4) written by Steven Richard Hollasch in 1991. Hypercube simply projects a 4-dimensional hypercube onto a 2-dimensional surface (your monitor).
